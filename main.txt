#Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language.
Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions,
and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable.
It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming.
So, Python is a dynamically typed language.

Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

In Python, we use input() function to take input from the user.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. 
If you enter an integer value still input() function convert it into a string.

Q8. What is type casting?

Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 
Using split() method
Using List comprehension


Q10. What are keywords?

Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Python print() function prints the message to the screen or any other standard output device.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands. 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

'/' and '//' belong to the arithmetic operators.

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0 => 1

0 and 0 => 0 

True and False and True => False

1 or 0 or 0 => 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program.
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

If: If is a keyword used to check if the condition is true or not and execute the corresponding statement .
elif : Used if the 'if' condition is not satisfied then check the remaining condition and print the corresponding statement then elif is used .
else : if the 'if' condition is not satisfied then the statment corresponding to the 'else' block will be executed .

lst.insert(2,"Big")
print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. 
Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple.
The contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

To create a tuple , you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple and enclosed in braces.
tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

No we cannot add our name to tuple since tuple are immutable and cannot be changed after creation.

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

No two tuple cannot be appended since tuples are immutable after creation.

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.

t2 = (20,30,40,50)
print(len(t2))

Q45. What are sets in Python?

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
It prevents duplocate value.

Q46. How can you create a set?

Sets are written with curly brackets.
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.add("iNeuron")

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

We cannot add multiple value using add function at the same time .

Q49. How is update() different from add()?

Add an item to a set, using the add() method.
To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

The clear() method empties the set.

Q51. What is frozen set?

The frozenset() function returns an immutable frozenset object initialized with elements from the given iterable.
Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

Return a set that contains all items from both sets, duplicates are excluded.
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.union(y)

print(z)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

Return a set that contains the items that exist in both set x, and set y.
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.intersection(y)

print(z)

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

A dictionary is a general-purpose data structure for storing a group of objects. A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value unlike other data structure 
in python where there is no key associated with it.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Q58. What will the output of the following?
var = {}
print(type(var)) =>  <class 'dict'>

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)
