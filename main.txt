#Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language.
Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions,
and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable.
It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming.
So, Python is a dynamically typed language.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros -  Beginner-friendly,Large Community,Flexible and Extensible,Extensive Libraries
Cons - High memory consumption,Dynamically-typed language,Slower than compiled languages


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Data Science,Automation,Web Development,AI & Machine Learning , Desktop GUI

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

In Python, we use input() function to take input from the user.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. 
If you enter an integer value still input() function convert it into a string.

Q8. What is type casting?

Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 
Using split() method
Using List comprehension


Q10. What are keywords?

Keywords in Python are reserved words that can not be used as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Python print() function prints the message to the screen or any other standard output device.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands. 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

'/' and '//' belong to the arithmetic operators.
'/' is used for the normal division of two numbers.
'//' is used to obtain the smallest integer nearest to the quotient obtained by dividing two numbers.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output. iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

n=int(input())

if(n%2==0):
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")


Q18. What are boolean operator?

Boolean Operators are those that result in the Boolean values of True and False .These include and, or and not .

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0 => 1

0 and 0 => 0 

True and False and True => False

1 or 0 or 0 => 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program.
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

If: If is a keyword used to check if the condition is true or not and execute the corresponding statement .
elif : Used if the 'if' condition is not satisfied then check the remaining condition and print the corresponding statement then elif is used .
else : if the 'if' condition is not satisfied then the statment corresponding to the 'else' block will be executed .

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age=int(input("Enter your age"))

if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list. numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if i%2==0:
        sum+=i
print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

x=int(input())
y=int(input())
z=int(input())

if (x>y) and (x>z):
    print("x is greatest",x)
elif (y>x) and (y>z):
    print("y is greatest",y)
else:
    print("z is greatest",z)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions
The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

div_five = [x for x in numbers if x%5==0]
greater = [y for y in div_five if y<150]
final=[]

for i in greater:
    if(i<500):
        final.append(i)
    else:
        break

print(final)
